# Ambient Occlusion Override
Allows the ambient occlusion post-processing effect to be manually adjusted in VRChat. Ambient occlusion is a post-processing effect that adds shading to crevices, corners, and other concave areas. With this mod, you can enable/disable ambient occlusion and adjust the intensity of the effect.
